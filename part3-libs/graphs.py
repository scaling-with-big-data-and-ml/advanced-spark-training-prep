"""
    Exercise: read the bike trips dataset and run some graph algorithms on it:
    - count the total number of bike stations
    - count the total number of trips in graph
    - show the top 5 stations that served as a starting point for the most bike trips
    - show the stations with the minimum ratio of inDegree/outDegree (stations where people leave but rarely arrive)
    - show the top 5 stations from an "importance" standpoint
    - find trip triangles in the graph with the same bike

    Make sure you rename "Start Station" and "End Station" as "src" and "dst" respectively.
